A series of programs designed to emulate optimization techniques from UCSB Math 132A - Optimization. Currently this repository has programs for the following methods:
- Linear Programs (in standard and non-standard form)
- Least Squares
- Conjugate-Gradient
- Kacsmarz's Algorithm

This programs are not necessarily programmatically optimized, but they do all do their jobs mathematically under the constraints outlined under each method.
