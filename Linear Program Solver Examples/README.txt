Both files implement the same problem, just one is in MATLAB and the other in Python. To see the setup of the problem, look at Problem 1 from Homework 1 for Math 132A - Optimization.

The MATLAB program does seem to be a bit more user friendly as you can change every part of the linear program manually in order to set up the problem however you feel, whereas the Python program, by default, always minimizes $c^Tx$ subject to $Ax \leq b$. Due to this, the Python example has negative values in every entry of A and b since the example we have based it on uses $Ax \geq b$. Similarly, if you wanted to instead maximize $c^Tx$, you could take the negative of the result of minimizing $-c^Tx$.
